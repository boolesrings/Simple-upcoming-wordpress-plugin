Yet another plugin to make a list of upcoming events.  Just add an
"EventDate" to any post, and then obtain a list of upcoming events
using the [upcoming] shortcode.

== Description ==

This is another simple plugin to add a little functionality of a
calendar to your blog.  With this plugin you can specify, for any of
your posts, an associated "EventDate".  Then, elsewhere on your site,
you can retrieve a list of future events using the [upcoming]
shortcode.

The [upcoming] shortcode supports several options:

* show_excerpt: if defined, an excerpt of the post will be included below the
post title

* show_date: if defined, the date will precede the post title

* date-format: if writing the date, do so using this php date format

The output can then be further formatted using CSS.  We recommend the plugin
"Improved Simpler CSS" for easy modification to the output!
